### Challenges

I was met with a variety of challenges. The largest was a lack of fundamental knowledge of the Insomnia application. Through my project I had to really get it together and I now know a lot more about Insomnia. This including making project folders and creating an area for my project to reside in. Creating these allowed me to be a LOT more organized.
