### Challenges

I was met with a variety of challenges. The largest was a lack of fundamental knowledge of the Insomnia application. Through my project I had to really get it together and I now know a lot more about Insomnia. This including making project folders and creating an area for my project to reside in. Creating these allowed me to be a LOT more organized. 

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
